Here are the following parts I was assisted with using Chat GPT/ Copilot:

//Prompt
Please write Java code that uses the getValidInput method to prompt the user for input and assign the values to variables D, d, and N. The getValidInput method should ensure that the input values are within the specified minimum and maximum boundaries:

For D (coil diameter):
Prompt: "Enter coil diameter D (m): "
Minimum value: 0.25
Maximum value: 1.3
Input type: non-integer (double)
For d (wire diameter):
Prompt: "Enter wire diameter d (m): "
Minimum value: 0.05
Maximum value: 2.0
Input type: non-integer (double)
For N (number of turns):
Prompt: "Enter number of turns N: "
Minimum value: 1
Maximum value: 15
Input type: integer


//Return

double D = getValidInput(scanner, "Enter coil diameter D (m): ", 0.25, 1.3, false);
double d = getValidInput(scanner, "Enter wire diameter d (m): ", 0.05, 2.0, false);
int N = (int) getValidInput(scanner, "Enter number of turns N: ", 1, 15, true);


//Prompt

Please write Java code that truncates the weight variable to two decimal places without rounding. 

//Return

double truncatedWeight = Math.floor(weight * 100) / 100.0; // Truncate the weight to 2 decimal places
System.out.printf("Weight: %.2f kgm/s^2%n", truncatedWeight);


//Prompt
Please write a Java method named calculateSpringWeight that calculates the weight of a spring. The method should
calculate the mass using the formula: mass = (N + 2) * D * Math.pow(d, 2), and find the weight by multiplying by the 
constant of gravity.

//Return
// Method to calculate spring weight
public static double calculateSpringWeight(double D, double d, int N) {
    double mass = (N + 2) * D * Math.pow(d, 2);
    return mass * GRAVITY; // Return the weight (display result in kgm/s^2)
}
